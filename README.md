Extend [Whatsapp-Web.js](https://wwebjs.dev/) Capabilities with [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/)

WhatsappAPI is a Node.js application that extends the capabilities of WhatsApp by providing a RESTful API using [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/). This allows developers to automate interactions with WhatsApp, handle incoming messages via callback APIs, and programmatically send messages.

> It is not guaranteed you will not be blocked by using this method. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn't be considered totally safe.

### Features
- Callback/Postback API: Receive incoming messages and notifications via a predefined callback endpoint.
- Send Messages API: Programatically send messages to WhatsApp contacts or groups.
- Integration Ready: Easily integrate with existing systems or applications using the RESTful API.

### Usage Scenario
- Use this repository to extend your WhatsApp automation capabilities by setting up a local server or deploying it to a VPS.
- Customize the API endpoints and handling logic to suit your specific automation needs.
- Ideal for developers looking to automate responses, notifications, or data processing via WhatsApp.

## Installation
> Node v18+ is required. 

### Windows
To get started just follow these simple steps

- Clone this repository

    ```cmd
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/WhatsappAPI.git
    ```
- Navigate into the project directory

    ```cmd
    cd WhatsappAPI
    ```
- Install dependencies

    ```cmd
    npm install
    ```

- Configure your WhatsApp session credentials and callback endpoints in the `.env` file.
- Start the server

    ```cmd
    npm run start
    ```

When you run the service for the first time, it will generate a QR code image that you can find at `/images/whatsapp-qrcode.png` or you can also visit `http://localhost:3000/view-session-qrcode`. Simply open WhatsApp on your phone, navigate to the WhatsApp Web section, and scan this QR code to start a session. Once the session is successfully created, you will see a `CONNECTED & READY TO USE` message in the console.

ðŸ¥³ Wohoo... Your WhatsappAPI is Ready to Use!

## Send Message
To send your first message, you need to use an API calling tool such as Postman, which you can install on your laptop or PC.

#### Request URL/Endpoint

```curl
http://localhost:3000/send/message
```
#### Example payload for sending message on `private-chat`

```json
{
    "message": "Hello Tanish",
    "client_id": "917XXXXXXX87",
    "token": "TOKEN-DEFINED-IN-ENV-FILE",
    "number": "916XXXXXXX90"
}
```
#### Example payload for sending message on a `group`

```json
{
    "message": "Hello Tanish",
    "client_id": "917XXXXXXX87",
    "token": "TOKEN-DEFINED-IN-ENV-FILE",
    "groupName": "GROUP-TITLE"
}
```

Use these payloads to send messages to either a private chat or a group. Make sure to replace the placeholder values with actual data and ensure your token matches the one defined in your environment file.
